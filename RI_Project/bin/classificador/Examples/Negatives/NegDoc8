Horizon Zero Dawn...can't say enough about it. Seeing it in 4K HDR is a site to behold for any gamer. If you have the means, I highly recommend it... Date published: 2017-04-17 Rated 5 out of 5 by RabidReflex from I love this console The Ps4 Pro is a step up from its brother the base Ps4. It definitely has better performance on games. I have not had any big problems or complaints with this console. I love the color and clarity of the console on my 4k TV. I will say the price is good if you have a 4K TV because you can take all the advantages of the Ps4 Pro but wuth just 1080p i would not buy this new console. This isnt the Ps5 its an upgraded Ps4. Date published: 2017-01-18 Rated 5 out of 5 by ChuckTheDrummer7 from Better than the slim I originally had the base model ps4 when it first came out, ran great, never had a single issue out of it. needed some cash and sold it, when the slim uncharted bundle came out i jumped on it and was very pleased with my purchase. the system was awesome and uncharted was simply amazing. i recently upgraded to the pro and it's without a doubt the best system i have ever owned, it is well worth the extra 100 bucks. the games look better, the colors are more vibrant, and i have noticed a huge difference in frame rate issues. they are pretty much obsolete. to me the console look look's freaking awesome, way better than the original ps4 or the slim. i am beyond excited worth my purchase. i have had it for a while now and i am in more in love with with each passing day!!!!!!! Date published: 2017-01-16 Rated 5 out of 5 by Kylemo222 from IT IS AMAZING!! The ps4 pro is amazing,yea it might be "The same" as the regular ps4 but for me it is not.The upscaling is incredible especially on battlefield 1.It is really fun and is a great start for 4k gaming on a console!10 out of 10 Date published: 2017-01-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by Crystalxdr from Loving it! I own the Xbox one and the PS4 pro, both brand new systems. I've seen some reviews that kind of blow my mind. Yes the PS4 Pro is built to be a powerful gaming focused, hince it being called a GAME CONSOLE. If you want to watch shows in 4K or game in 4k, get the pro. My experience so far with both systems is, the Xbox one is way slower compared to the download and play speed of the pro, as in frustratingly slow. Even if the you have to get a 4K player, the pro is still the way to go. I haven't experienced any lag with the games, movies, or shows on the ps4 pro as of yet. As for the Xbox one, I sadly can't say the same...
